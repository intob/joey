<h2>Programming Languages</h2>

<p>I'm strongest in Go, with some years of experience writing code that runs at scale. I'm actively learning Zig, and I'm deeply enjoying the process.
  I'm familiar with C and Rust (book completed).</p>

<h2>Present</h2>

<p>I've recently been working on an anonymised proof-of-work based distributed hash table, with an innovative trust mechanism.
  A writer pays in CPU cycles, while a reader pays in network participation.
  It's a relatively simple protocol, yet performant and with many possible applications.

<p>I also have a side-project. I'm in the initial phase of a project to build a decentralised CDN for non-profits. I want to collaborate with home-owners and schools to make use of untapped bandwidth.</p>
<p>I also want to share the process of building and operating servers and networks with the kids, as I would have loved this opportunity at their age.
  I also feel that more kids should experience Linux.</p>

<h2>Past</h2>

<h3>2018 - 2024: Senior Software Engineer, swissinfo.ch</h3>
<p>After 2 years, and following the departure of the operations team and the most senior developer, I was given more responsibility than I would've ever expected.
  This was also the initial phase of a multi-million Swiss Franc project to migrate a monolithic CMS and millions of content items to a cloud-based service architecture.
  I was also the only developer on the team able to write languages other than Java.</p>
<p>I delivered thousands of lines of Terraform that defined the new infrastructure, including Postgres DBs, CDN distributions, S3 configs, IAM policies, Secrets, integrations with Azure, logging, search clusters, you name it.</p>
<p>Due to the company's (questionable) decision to use AWS products **whenever** possible, I wrote many Lambda functions in Go to connect these products using the AWS SDK.</p>
<p>My biggest task was to build a web application to augment the company's chosen CMS, Wordpress.
  It's called Toolbox, and called almost all of our APIs, giving journalists a snappy user experience like nothing I've seen before.
  It was buildless plain JS, and with the only dependency being Google's Lit framework.
  The whole app was around 3000 lines plus the library, totalling around 100KB in size.
  Nope, it wasn't even minified, so we could even debug it easily without source maps.
<p>By this point, I'd also garnered enough trust that I was able to spend an occasional few days refactoring without my boss wondering what I was doing.
  This resulted in the product staying as clean as on day one. GG.</p>
<p>That sounds so good, why did you leave? I'm happy to finish the story during our call. ;)</p>

<h3>2014 - 2017: Ski Bum, Blazing Fast</h3>
<p>I lived in an off-grid shack in the forest, in Chamonix, France.
  I worked as a freelance Web Developer. My main client was Trek & Mountain Magazine.
  My focus during this time was skiing and flying.</p>

<h3>2011 - 2014: Higher Engineering Apprentice, General Electric Aviation Systems</h3>
<p>My journey as a professional engineer began at age 18.
  I completed a challenging and highly-competitive 3 year Higher Engineering Apprenticeship.
  This is where I learned many engineering principles that continue to serve me well.</p>

<h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>My uncle gave my mum a computer to help with her business.
  I was around 8 years of age. At around age 12, I discovered programming with VB.NET.</p>
<p>At age 14, I began with C. I remember writing Conway's Game of Life 3 or 4 times, making it faster & cleaner.
  I had hundreds of projects.
  I was using stuff like Microsoft Live's free ASP.NET web hosting, then PHP, writing to files with MD5 sums for filenames.
  I just figured it out somehow, as a kid does.</p>
<p>Once, I made a password manager, and gave it to a friend to test, he also gave it to a friend.
  I recieved a C# For Dummies book, kindly ordered from my own Amazon account.
  I haven't made a password manager since, actually!</p>
