Every 210,000 blocks (approximately every 4 years), there is a block-reward halving. From that moment,  miners receive half the reward of bitcoin for mining a block.

The halving process will continue until the maximum supply of 21 million bitcoin is mined. Afterwards, miners earn only transaction fees for processing transactions.

Due to the fixed supply, 1 bitcoin is worth 1/21 million of all that bitcoin is worth.

# 21 million bitcoin.

Bitcoin's value is also tied to the hashrate. As hashrate increases, the energy required to mine blocks increases proportionally.

Bitcoin's hashrate depends on availability of energy to manufacture & power computers.

As we channel more energy, the energetic equivalent of 1 bitcoin will continue to increase.

It a blazing fire of computing power. As long as someone is adding fuel, it will burn.
