title: Speedflying Coaching
description: I can help you increase your safety margin, and then work with you to develop your piloting.
---
I've been speedflying since 2014. I've made most, if not all, of the mistakes that you can make as a pilot. I've reformed my flying style multiple times, experimented, and applied learnings from other mountain sports. My experience with cross-country paragliding has helped my ability to assess weather conditions.

My goal is to share the love that I have for speedflying, with a focus on increasing the safety margin.

I will first ensure that your fundamental takeoff and landing abilities are sound. If anything can be improved, we will work on that until your skills make you as safe as possible. This is absolutely crucial for a long and healthy flying career.

With safe and consistent launches and landings, we can then explore piloting techniques. This is where you discover and develop your flying style. I will be with you at takeoff for each flight, and often following if that is something that you would like. Our aim here is to play within reasonable bounds, as always with safety being our primary concern.

During non-flying days, and after flying, we can do some theory. I will share my approach to finding new lines, assessing weather, and predicting conditions. We can also discuss flying technique.

Options include lift-accessed laps, hike-and-flys, and overnight stays in huts, or wild camping where permitted.

I offer these experiences on a one-to-one, or a small group basis. I operate primarily in the UK and the European Alps, although we can travel further-afield if you wish. We can also visit multiple locations during our time. Please get in touch for pricing, and to discuss your goals and expectations.

My flying certifications:
- SIV Training, with Beni - 2022
- Paragliding License, Swiss - 2021

Note:
I am not a paragliding instructor, and therefore I cannot take responsibility for your decisions while flying. I can only provide advice, feedback, and share my knowledge as an experienced pilot.
