I realized how far I've come in the last 5 years. From partial-paraplegic in a wheelchair, to the health, peace & serenity of the present.

I thank you all for the love, help and guidance. Thank you to those who believed in me. Thank you to those who taught me that we are worth loving. Thank you to those who taught me to dream a world into being.

These are some of my favourite flights from one incredible year. Enjoy üå±ü§ç
