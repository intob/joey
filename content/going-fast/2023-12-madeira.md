Flare have given me a Line 8 (cheers Beni), and they asked me if I'd kindly take it flying.

Considering the Maritime alps, I looked further afield, to warmer climes. I almost went to Corsica.

After hearing of the Bitcoin conference and arranging wirh a couple of friends to go together, I saw photos & videos of this incredible island.

My imagination ran wild as I explored 3d maps, marvelling at the topograpgy.

The island is inhabited by one of the friendliest populations I've ever seen.

I felt the people to be especially beautiful, relaxed & kind. Very refreshing.

We enjoyed almost every sunrise & sunset on the mountains or by the sea.

Almost every day, we swam in the sea.

We ate only one meal per day. Each meal was incredible.

Enjoy the video of my flying with this interesting wing.
