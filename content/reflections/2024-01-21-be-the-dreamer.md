I find it interesting that we are witnessing an ever-increasing rate of progress. Our species is rapidly becoming more powerful at channelling energy.

Possibly in my lifetime, we will have machines that build machines, that build machines, that build machines, that build machines, that build machines, that build machines, that build machines, that build machines.

Imagine an ever-growing non-organic life-form. It would accelerate across galaxies.

Currently, we are a single-planet organism. Life logarithmically expands from primitive structures, occasionally into multi-planetary civilizations. I beleive that earth is one such life-form. An organism of water, land & air -dwelling beings. The earth is a seed, flying with the wind of the universe. What a time to be alive. What a time to dream.
