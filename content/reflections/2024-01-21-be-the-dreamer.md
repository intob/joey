The world's money is inflating into nothing, as water evaporates from stones heated by the sun.

We are living through the collapse of our money.

I find it interesting that at the same time, we are witnessing an ever-increasing rate of progress. Our species is rapidly becoming more powerful at channelling energy.


Possibly in my lifetime, we will have machines that build machines, that build machines, that build machines, that build machines, that build machines, that build machines, that build machines, that build machines.

## Your dreams, constantly manifesting physically...

Imagine an ever-growing non-organic life-form. It would accelerate across galaxies.

Imagine laying in your bed, with only your mind, flying multiple avatars across galaxies. Clones of your mind travelling at immense speed through space.

Currently, we are a single-planet organism. Life logarithmically expands from primitive structures, occasionally into multi-planetary civilizations.

I beleive that earth is one such life-form. An organism of water, land & air -dwelling beings. The earth is a seed, flying with the wind of the universe.

What a time to be alive. What a time to dream.

## Don't be dreamed, be the dreamer.
