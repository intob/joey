title: Leaving some projects unfinished is critical for innovation.

As I browse old works from venerable computer scientists, I often encounter brilliant yet unfinished projects.

This led me to reflect on my own habbit of leaving personal projects unfinished. I see merit in occasionally parking ideas indefinitely. That is, if the real goal of any personal project is not to output a peice of work, but to learn skills necessary for a future project, it follows that we must let it go once we see a bridge to the next phase of learning.

For the sake of my employability, I must note that I understand the critical importance of finishing tasks and outputting fully tested software in the context of business. However, we must remain honest with ourselves amd others about the utility of old ideas when superior ideas are conceived. We must balance our propensity for learning with business requirements and the need to deliver quality products.

For instance, Charles Babbage's unfinished Analytical Engine and Difference Engine laid the groundwork for modern computing, despite never being completed in his lifetime.

The psychological tension created by unfinished tasks, known as the Zeigarnik effect, may keep us motivated to eventually complete tasks. This effect suggests that starting a project, even if we can't finish it immediately, increases our commitment to completing it later. Additionally, the Ovsiankina effect indicates that interrupted tasks create a desire to finish them, which may be harnessed to maintain productivity.

We must balance this with the need to limit the amount of work in progress in order to maintain efficiency. I've noticed that I work much better when I focus almost entirely on a single topic until it's either finished or parked. I do allow some time each day for other tasks, allowing me to step out of monotony when I lack motivation.

It's important to recognize when a project no longer serves its purpose or when a superior idea emerges. In such cases, it may be more beneficial to pivot and focus on the new idea rather than clinging to an outdated one. This flexibility is crucial for innovation and continuous improvement.

In conclusion, while unfinished projects can be valuable for learning, the professional context demands a balance between exploration and completion. By integrating learning within structured project management, we can achieve both personal development and deliver high-quality, fully tested software that meets business requirements.
