Real-time logging (tail & query) for virtually unlimited logs. A map of in-memory ring buffers. Built on UDP & homegrown ephemeral HMAC. Go std lib + Protobuf. Image is built from scratch (Linux kernel + app executable).

I'm about to move this app into a private network. During this move, I will whitelabel & opensource it. I need to add a config loader.

Hang tight! This one is cool.
