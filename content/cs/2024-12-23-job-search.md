description: I left a lucrative Software Engineering role in Switzerland, and went travelling. I'm now open to opportunities...

In spring, left SwissInfo after 5 years with them. The team was lovely, and the pay was great, but I reached a plateau and needed a new challenge. I ended up leaving Switzerland all-together, and went travelling for the entire summer.

I thought that I wanted to pursue music and continue making my speedflying videos, but after a month or so, I realised that you can't force creativity. Music will be a past-time for me.

I also realised the reason that I love writing software... I find it challenging, deeply interesting, and I love the rabbit holes that I find myself going down while researching.

When I arrived in the UK after 5 years of life in Switzerland, I was convinced that I would find a great position as a Senior Software  Engineer. I sent applications, but had few responses, and no offers.

I started to doubt my skills, and looked into doing a Masters in Computer Science instead. I'm still considering this.

I'm currently reading the 2nd edition of Jean-Philippe Aumasson's book, Serious Cryptography. He is one of the most brilliant contemporary cryptographers. As I enjoy desigining efficient network protocols, I know this book will help me to harden my future work.

I think that there is still a lot of cryptography for us to discover. Each advancement unlocks new technology that was previously thought impossible, or not even conceived of.

Anyway... I'm looking for an opportunity to work (possibly unpaid) in systems and network programming. Please reach me if you know of anything.
